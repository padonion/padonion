**Welcome on my repository**,

my name is Christophe and I'm a Senior software engineer.

I have multiple preferred topics in Computer Science, the first one being Computer Vision which is my specialty in my company.
I also like to design system, that can be for a special need or just for fun like most of us.

I'm also a mountain hiker and love to spend time watching nature. 

In the repositories, I will try to keep the public projects as clear as possible.
